                    <p>
                        A conceptual schema in many of the ‚Äúbest opening attacks‚Äù in my new book, Become a Chess Assassin!, is:
                    </p>
                    <div class="list">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Start with a solid opening but choose a line where it is likely that the game will be tactical than positional (for instance, starting with the king‚Äôs pawn opening 1. e4 with White).
                            </li>
                            <li>Use a probing or provocative move that is tricky for the opponent to navigate. The risk needs to be commensurate with the potential gain.
                            </li>
                            <li>When the opponent plays an inaccuracy, strike assertively to capture the initiative, which should hopefully cascade towards a rapid win, or at least, a major advantage out of the opening.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        A very common inaccuracy in the opening, especially at the beginner-intermediate level, is an early queen move. Now, there are opening lines where an early queen attack is accurate, or part of well understood theory. However, it can often be difficult to find the accurate queen moves, especially when the queen comes under attack by pawns and other less valuable pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I‚Äôve recently played three unrated games against Random Noob that demonstrate this well. From the perspective of playing in the Romantic style in the opening, the tactical notion is that one must punish the opponent for their early queen move immediately. A slower more positional approach might gift the opponent just enough time to consolidate, which then justifies their queen development to our detriment. Counterattacking our opponent‚Äôs intemperate queen often allows us to win tempo and developmental advantage, which becomes a fertile ground for setting up a beautiful winning combination!
                    </p>
                    <div class="heading">
                        <h2>Game 1: Sicilian Defense: Smith-Morra Gambit Queen Trap!
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In the first game, I had the White pieces, Black plays the Sicilian Defense, and it was clear that they didn‚Äôt know how to respond the Smith-Morra Gambit, declining it with (2‚Ä¶ Nc6). This is a mistake as Black‚Äôs knight can immediately be attacked by d5. However, just like in the game with ProfessorJ in my last article who made a similar move, sometimes one can launch a more powerful attack by taking a calculated risk to develop a piece first, before striking forth against a minor piece. This worked as (3. Nf3!? d5 4. exd5! Qxd5 5. Nc3!): I‚Äôd baited Black‚Äôs queen to develop to the centre of the board, and now started a series of attacks on Black‚Äôs queen with development!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On turn 5, Black plays (5‚Ä¶ Qe6+?!), a move that doesn‚Äôt obviously look bad, but as we‚Äôll see a powerful tactic suddenly becomes available for White. Simply, if I could get a knight onto the c7 square, it would be a family fork!
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../images/article_8_1.jpg" alt="article 8" class="image1">
                        </div>
                        <figcaption class="credit">
                            After (5‚Ä¶ Qe6+?!) my short-term goal is Nc7+ family fork; indeed even the threat of Nc7+ becomes forcing!
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        In the following few turns, I force/encourage some trades in the centre, develop my own queen, and with (9. Nd5), I‚Äôm threatening to make good Nc7+! Black recognises the tactic, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it is necessarily easy to navigate. They found (9‚Ä¶ Qc6?), which makes sense. The queen defends the c7 square and counterattacks my c2-pawn. Danger averted right? NO! ü§©
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I now had the brilliant move (10. Bb5!!), directly attacking the queen with a seemingly sacrificial move. However, if Black captures the ‚Äúhanging‚Äù bishop with (10‚Ä¶ Qxb5??), then once again Nc7+ would be a family fork!
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../images/article_8_2.png" alt="article 8" class="image 2">
                        </div>
                        <figcaption class="credit">
                            (10. Bb5!!) is a brilliancy; I‚Äôm proud to have found it!
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        More than that, there was a second layer to this attack. Again, Black saw the tactic, but probably thought that there were no problems as they could move their queen out of the attack with (10‚Ä¶ Qxc2), winning my c-pawn. However, this was a blunder, and they didn‚Äôt see that their queen was going to be lost in a number of ways!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Turn 11, I capture Black‚Äôs bishop with check (11. Bxd7+) and Black‚Äôs best response is to accept that their queen is lost by capturing back the bishop (11‚Ä¶ Kxd7) and allowing (12. Nb4+): the knight move reveals a discovered check, and the knight attacks Black‚Äôs queen on c2!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Black avoided the capture, having calculated the imminent loss of their queen and sidestepped with (11‚Ä¶ Kd8?!), an understandable move, but to no avail as (12. Ba4!?), and I once again force Black to respond to an attack on their queen. The curious thing is that Black‚Äôs queen is basically trapped. Any move of their queen would result in some version of a knight move with discovered check and an attack on their queen! In the game, they ran their queen (12‚Ä¶ Qf5??) which is [+M5]. I capture Black‚Äôs queen, and then with my queen and bishop pair, pluck Black‚Äôs king from the back rank, corral him to the a-file, and deliver checkmate. Good game, GG!
