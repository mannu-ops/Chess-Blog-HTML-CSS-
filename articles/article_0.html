                        The question on everyone's mind was, how will Gukesh fare in the second game after suffering a loss? He answered it quite well by playing a solid draw. At the post-game press conference he mentioned that, "We all knew that things can happen. Losing is just part of the game. So it was not a shock. We were prepared..." He is definitely strong mentally. That was evident both on the board and off it. He also added that, "Today was a good day and hopefully we will have many more good days coming." The teenager is definitely poised to bring some exciting games and a lot of determination in the next few games as he is facing the best version of the world champion, Ding Liren, which the world knew and wanted to see.

                        Not so much happened in the game. My feeling went up and down. At some point, I thought I misplayed the opening preparation, I mean slightly worse in the middlegame. I am not sure if my assessment is correct or not. It might be incorrect. I think my position was passive and he had a very strong knight on d4. I realized that I analyze this kind of position with computers, white is slightly better in this pawn structure. I don't know if I am wrong or maybe there is just nothing more." - Ding Liren's thoughts on Game 2. "Well my basic idea is to play carefully and I am completely fine with a draw. I am happy with the final result. I may get something out of the opening because I remember we checked until 12.b3 and my second said, it's 0.2 according to the computer... Maybe I had some chances at some point, I don't know." - The world champion's words on if he is okay with a draw.

                        A draw with black in a World Championship Match is always nice and it's too early. We still have a long match ahead." - D Gukesh on whether he is happy with today's result.

                        The Classical rated game before the World Championship Match, between Ding Liren and D Gukesh was at Sinquefield Cup in August this year. It witnessed a similar Italian Opening. The world champion decided to put his knight on c3 this time, instead of his pawn there.

                        It's not a huge surprise. It's one of the topical lines recently. I was just trying to recollect what I had seen and I think I got a fairly comfortable position. White always has a very very slight edge but if Black is careful which I was, I don't think there is anything" - D Gukesh on his opponent's choice of opening.

                        "Rdc1 is an idea in this kind of pawn structure but in the game, I am not sure if it is a good move. I don't think it is a good move. I don't know how to develop as he has such a strong knight on d4. Then I move my rook back to d1, that means maybe I am not happy with 14.Rdc1" - The world champion on spending a lot of time behind 14.Rdc1 and its aftermath. Maurice Ashley mentioned that he was discussing a line with Vishy Anand 14.Ne1 Rxd1 15.Rxd1 Nxa5 16.Nd3 Nd7 17.Nd5 c6 18.Ne7+ Kh7 19.Nb2 and computer says White has slight edge. Gukesh mentioned that he stopped after 16...Nd7. He found the variation Maurice showed to be interesting. The game ended in a draw after nine more moves as neither side had an opportunity to make a progress in the double rook and double knight endgame.
