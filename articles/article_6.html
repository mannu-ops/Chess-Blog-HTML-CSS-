                    <p>
                        I will deal with this from the perspective of a chess teacher, and what information he would feed a player who has just absorbed the most basic rules.
                    
                        After a person learns how to move the pieces (with POINT COUNT being a part of that – it’s important he know the generic value of the pieces: Pawn – 1, Knight & Bishop – 3, Rook – 5, Queen – 9, and the King – priceless), the teacher needs to give the student quizzes that help him understand HOW THE PIECES AND PAWNS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. He’ll supply him with many simple positions that feature captures (you capturing his pieces and his pieces threatening to capture yours), pointing to a square and asking which of your pieces can go there, etc. Lots and lots of this very basic stuff is a huge help to the beginner, and not only prevents him from tossing his own guys away, but also makes him aware of opportunities to chop off enemy bits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A mix of very simple and mildly complicated examples of piece interaction will keep the student on his toes. Here’s an example of a rather complex situation. Black to move seems to be able to capture on e4 with his Bishop, g4 with his Knight, and e5 with his Rook and d6-pawn. But is all that legal or good? And does White threaten anything? And what about 1…f5, threatening both e4 and g4. Would 1…f5 2.Bxf5 be a good reply?
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../images/article_6_1.png" alt="article 6" class="image2">
                        </div>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Note that, in this example, it's not important who is and isn't better. What is important is that the student note all the possible captures and threats.

                        One very basic form of piece interaction is CHECKMATE and STALEMATE, and this needs to be clearly explained since many beginners are confused by the differences between the two.
                    </p>

                    <figure>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="../images/article_6_2.png" alt="article 6" class="image2">
                        </div>
                    </figure>

                    <p>
                        1…Rxa3 is mate since the King is in check and has no way of removing the checking piece or stepping out of the check. The tempting 1…Qxb3?? seems powerful, but that would result in a draw by stalemate since white’s King is NOT in check, has no legal moves, and his Bishop is also not allowed to move since that would allow …Rxa1.
</p>
<p>
Once all the piece movements/interactions are hardwired into the player’s head, and once he has a good feel for how they can threaten, take, and defend other pieces, it’s time for these four oldies but goodies:

<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li> DEVELOP ALL YOUR PIECES as rapidly as possible!
        </li>
        <li> CASTLE as quickly as you can!
        </li>
        <li>
            Use your pieces and pawns to CONTROL AS MUCH OF THE CENTER AS POSSIBLE. It might seem early to give this kind of quasi-advanced material, but instilling a desire to own the center sets up good habits down the line, and also compels beginners to develop their pieces towards the middle of the board.
        </li>
        <li>
            ROOKS BELONG ON OPEN FILES! This is important to toss at the student right away! Why? Because he’s going to find that it’s far from easy to get his Rooks into play (since the pawns curtail their activity). Show him how his pawns block his Rooks, and give him examples of purposely trading the blocking pawns off so the Rooks can have scope. This will prove a tad advanced, but do it anyway since the ideas will linger in the student’s subconscious mind.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
Of course, the teacher will give many examples of all four of these things, and test the student with problems and perhaps even mini-games, which would ensure the previous lessons are rammed home.
